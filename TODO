blockcrafter:
- correct asset management (remember minecraft: prefix somehow)
- export options (rotation, outputdir, size, asset path)
- use vispy instead of glumpy?
- docker file for easy running on server?

blockcrafter rendering:
- modeldef rescale attribute
- blockdef uvlock attribute
- mirroring texture with uv attributes
- check if rotations are correct, and also texture rotations
- flat lighting correct
- smooth lighting? maybe u/v/side texture for each block image
- biomes?
- water?
- render order of transparent things?
- cauldron doesn't have water in it, but gray placeholder?
- blocks with multiple textures? like water/fire
- black_concrete looks bigger than one cube

mapcrafter integration:
- read new world format
- block registry that maps block/variant to internal id
- chunks store internal IDs
- new block images class that reads blocks / associates them with internal id
- specify directory with block images / read from predefined path based on texture size, rotation etc. ?
- smooth lighting

- mapcrafter compability with older maps? maybe make a mapcrafter2 out of this?
- is it okay to integrate block images with mapcrafter? have them download / build them themselves?
